============================

When you are working with complex vectors and matrices dealing with real and
imaginary parts is a common task.  The following is supported in FLENS:

- For complex valued dense vectors you can create real valued dense vectors
  that reference the real or imaginary vector parts.  This is possible as
  as a dense vector reference can reference elements that are separated by
  a constant stride.
- For complex valued matrices of type `GeMatrix` we support copying the real
  and imaginary parts to a real valued matrix and vice versa.  Note that
  it is not possible that a `GeMatrix` view can be used to reference the real
  or imaginary part of a complex valued `GeMatrix`:
    - If a `GeMatrix` stores elements in row major order then row elements
      must be contiguously in memory.  However, complete rows can be separated
      by a constant stride.
    - If a `GeMatrix` stores elements in col major order then column elements
      must be contiguously in memory.  However, complete columns can be
      separated by a constant stride.
  If you have complex elements and want to reference only the real or imaginary
  part there always will be gaps.  So a new matrix type is defined for this
  case.  However, BLAS functionality for this type is limited to `copy`.
